                <h4 class="text-white">mechanisms of meaning</h4>
                <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">This week’s reading covered the artistic journeys of master diagram makers Arakawa and Gins through the book “The Mechanism of Meaning.” The intro covers how Arakawa first got into the art scene here in the United States, creating a network of famous artists including musician and filmmaker Yoko Ono, composer John Milton Cage, and pop artist Andy Warhol through his work in Japan and New York. In New York City, he connected with Marcel Duchamp, learning and becoming more associated with diagrammatic art (through Duchamp’s French-educated perspective) instead of the traditional landscape and portrait studies artists underwent. I found this part interesting, especially since the author chose to dub diagramming as an “artistic visual language”, explicitly merging the worlds of language and art, where those are typically exclusive, one used to express the other and one used to describe the other. At this point, I decided to actually look up excerpts of the actual text of “The Mechanism of Meaning,” and was greeted with images that to me were bizarre and incomprehensible. A page on localization and transference provided me with sentences claiming “if possible look at this” with “if possible look at that” right under it, complete with a drawing of block letters writing out “THAT”, left me bewildered. What could this mean? The format of the pages reminded me slightly of optical illusions; short bits of text attached to diagrams meant to fool your mind. I returned to the original article to read more, and realized that I had done exactly as Arakawa and Gins intended; I questioned the image, the content of the few pages I was able to find in the book, and I observed the pages of this book from within my own subjective reality. What I had considered nonsense mere minutes ago I now looked at through a different lens, understanding that this artwork is not based solely in traditional art styles solely for the viewer’s pleasure (in fact, it is barely based in that at all) but rather meant to probe into the reader’s worldview while simultaneously introducing their own. This is not just artistic visual language, which is something I would personally label numerous pieces of artwork under, but philosophical artistic questioning, intended to get the viewer to think and respond to a vague prompt. The author of this article compares Arakawa’s and Gins’ work to “playful physics,” and I agree in that it is intellectually intensive and takes the viewer to their analytical limits. </p>

                    "All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace" was especially interesting because of how it focused on Ayn Rand's philosophies. Perhaps my favorite part of this experience was reading the comments, one of which said "Only America would give Ayn Rand the time of day." The only reason I think she remains relevant is because people are desperate for some sort of scientific basis to support their own greed, and Ayn Rand is a perfect excuse to do so.

                  Materiality is manifested in poor images through viral reproductions and widespread reach; it is almost a record of vivacious human activity, fragments of a large puzzle to be put together by the observer and caught in "uploaded, downloaded, shared, reformatted, reedited" stages of being. Poor images have the ability to transcend the notions of class and social hierarchy that come with high quality, liberating itself from the confines of an original image and allowed to take form as any idea it wants to be. Although quality is sacrificed, accessibility is increased, and it caters to the ever-distracted group of Internet meme-rs that scour websites for something that doesn't require contemplation and specific backgrounds, but rather something that they can digest with ease. Digital images are able to be reproduced much more quickly than non-digital images, allowing them to expand their reach and affect more people. It also allows for even more reproductions, taking part in almost an infinite loop of recreation. While poor images may only literally be parts or "violated" versions of an original, the entire way we reproduce them is a method of creativity in itself.

                    Rauschenberg is especially interesting in that his work nearly defined an entire new movement in pop art. His work differs from other art historically in that it was not conventionally beautiful; one of my favorite parts of the reading was looking at the review that another artist gave him where he said that Rauschenberg's art wasn't that good, then retracted that statement a full two years later. His work resembles the internet in that it is collages of various materials; he does not restrict himself solely to something like classical paintings, but rather explores performance and printmaking and photography. It's almost like the "poor image" we read about earlier in the "Internet Art" assignment, where he was taking things that historically have been perceived as already whole but he'd take them apart and put them back together again in his own way.

                  I think humans can absolutely be understood through cybernetics. We're in a time where lots of people spend 15 hours on their phones and laptops per week; lots of young people, especially those who are struggling socially, find refuge in online social communities. People go to YouTube to learn and to Alexa to get basic questions answered and basic commands completed. We're in a time where lots of people are defined by their interactions with technology, and where much of our work is dependent on or at least affected by what they do and interact with on the internet. Machines are used to make things we need and robots are increasingly used in areas of assistance; sex robots for the lonely, physical robots for the elderly, learning robots for young children. Cybernetics is now core to what it means to live in modern times, especially in a place where so much of our work requires computers and machines.

                    Foucault's focuses on the power of people and the average citizen. His work and views parallel Cybernetics in that he explores the connections and causality in communications between people of power and people without, whereas cybernetics explores the connections between machines and living things (namely humans). He really explores the history of punishment and government, and how parties must cooperate in order for law and civic structures to succeed. I sort of agree that our lives are shaped by these systems of control and these systems of control have been around for millennia. The Panopticon plays out in contemporary times in that many systems of power generally have 1 person overlooking everything, and the normal people live in fear of being caught because they are unaware of when they are being watched. This is a big part of the reason why people don't break the law all the time; they don't know when they are being watched so they act in accordance with the rules.

                You understand the individual based on the individual's environments and responses to said environments. Families, governments, educational systems - individuals are defined by their surroundings and are destined to be defined by these surroundings until the end of time. This text relates to Foucault's ideas on control in that it literally defines the individual based on what controls them. Surfing is mentioned because it ties in with defining an individual based on what they control or what controls them; as Deleuze puts it, "the man of contrul is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network."

                    Pierre's work is riveting in that it spans a variety of mediums, including human nature and technology. I found his piece "Anlee" to be particularly interesting; he purchased the copyrights to a Japanese manga character and loans it out to other artists rather than to advertising agencies (the typical route) in order to support individual narratives and stories and see what various authors can do with the same character. How do they speak through them? How does Anlee change with every owner of her copyright?

                  After this reading, I think that theoretically, thought can go on without a body. AI is a great example of this; Lyotard examines how humans can employ all types of logic while machines are generally restricted to a binary logic rooted in rationality, unaffected by emotion and/or intuition. Senses can be replicated without having some sort of corporeal medium through various computer technologies, and that's really the only thing computers need to interact with. At an even lower level, thought is really just the analysis of data, so all you need is data and a way to analyze it.

                    "Let one hundred genders bloom" is a quote that I found particularly interesting in this reading. This explores xenofeminism and all its assets, and in the part where it talks about 100 genders, it's actually talking about how genders can restrict a society and continue to contribute to asymmetry in power; it is always restrained under patriarchal control and needs to be free. It almost dismantles the notion of gender, saying that the gender binary isn't necessary and the goal is to be free of gender rather than to reduce it to something digestible to the general public. By abolitioning gender, we come closer to abolishing class and unfair aspects of socioeconomics, which are heavily rooted in cultural perceptions of the abilities and desires of genders (especially with regards to docile femininity and overpowerful masculinity).

                    The Internet of Things is pretty cool but also lowkey scary. I remember learning about it when I was younger and thinking it was the coolest thing in the whole world - talk to your computer! Your thermostat! Your refrigerator! Everything! Under your command! But now it's become a little much. I'm not really about having my data mined and sold by large companies to cater content to what they think I want; it sort of feels like internet prostitution. And to a certain extent, you really are selling yourself. People do surveys online to get some money, not knowing that the company giving the survey is selling that information for more money than the user is getting. Anyways, back to IoT - I think having companies like Amazon collect your info using an Alexa is terrifying. I think it's even more terrifying that they partnered with Facebook to create that thing that not only talks and listens to you, but also watches you - two companies that historically don't give a shit about user privacy or really any sort of ethics.

                  I think this is super interesting - the notion that the internet does not exist is interesting and something that I actually sort of agree with it. It's true that everything on the internet is manipulated to some extent, whether it's unintentionally through compression or the fact that images and words will never truly capture reality or the fact that people willingly and consciously make the decision to change things, whether it be through malicious political campaigns or lit meme spreading groups, the internet is never truly representative of reality.

                    Art is super important in politics, because it gets complex political information down to the masses in a digestible manner. I've read about augmented reality ads at bus stops where people can take out their phones and scan a QR code to launch an app and virtually learn about their legislators. Art is also a great means for revolution and humor in times of difficulty. One of my favorite pieces of art is when people project offensive images of Donald Trump (small hands, floats, whatever) onto the side of his buildings, or when the Trump chicken was by the White House lawn. Because art goes for people's feelings, and most people act based on emotion, it's critical to the way things work.
